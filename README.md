   - `$ pip install flake8`

   - goto root directory where `main.py` file is present.
   - Run this command and check for any errors:

   - `$ python -m flake8`

9. run `main.py`
   - `$ python main.py`
   - by default it will run with 4 default arguments:
     `-c bitcoin -f INR -p 1200000 -t 300`
   - these all are optional arguments, if you want to give arguments then it will take that otherwise it will defaults to the above arguments.
